## What is OnTheSpot?

OnTheSpot is a simple and user-friendly music downloader built with Qt and Python. It allows you to search for songs, artists, albums, and playlists, and download them straight to your device. Designed to be easy to use and efficient, it works across multiple platforms, so anyone can enjoy their favorite music offline.

## How It Works

OnTheSpot is used to search and download music. You can perform searches by entering queries or URLs, and the app will fetch the corresponding media. Downloads are managed efficiently, with options to customize download settings, formats, and directories.

### Installation
